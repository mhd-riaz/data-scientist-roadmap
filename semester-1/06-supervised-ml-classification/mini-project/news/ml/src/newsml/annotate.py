"""Export articles for blind human labelling, and read the completed sheets back.

The gold set is the only thing every reported number rests on, so two properties
matter more than convenience:

* **Blind.** The sheet carries the title and summary and nothing else. No source,
  no URL, no proposed label. A labeller who sees "Wired" types `technology`
  without reading, and the feed URLs literally contain the section name, so
  either would leak the weak label into the gold set and turn the agreement
  study into a measurement of itself.
* **Reproducible.** The sample is drawn with a fixed seed from a fixed corpus, so
  the same command produces the same sheet.

One article per story group: labelling three copies of the same wire story costs
three times as much and yields one label's worth of information.

    Round 1 drew at random and returned 20 `conflict_war` labels out of 1,200,
    because that is roughly how often armed conflict appears in the feeds. No
    larger random sample fixes that: at 1.7% prevalence, 150 labels of it needs
    9,000 draws from a corpus that holds about 7,400. So each class states how
    many labels it still wants, and the articles most like the ones it already
    has are retrieved to fill the gap.

    `per_class` is a target to *end up at*, not a number to hand out. A class
    already there is sampled zero times, and a class below it retrieves more
    candidates than the gap — enough that the labels it yields close the gap once
    retrieval's own error rate is paid for. See `_retrieval_precision`.

    The ranking is nearest-centroid over TF-IDF: a class is represented by the
    average of the articles a human already filed under it, with its taxonomy
    description mixed in so a class with few examples still has a direction, and
    the publisher's own topical tags folded into the text on both sides.
    Classes take turns rather than each taking its whole quota in one go, so a
    common class cannot drain the pool before a rare one has been served.

    That text score is then weighted by where the class actually turns up. A
    section feed such as "The Guardian — Sport" already supplies its own weak
    label, so the classes with a section are the ones already served, and the
    ones without are hiding in the general and city desks: 100% of round 1's
    `politics_protest` and 86% of its `disaster_accident` came from a source with
    no topic label, against 2% of `tech_consumer`. See `_desk_prior`.

    `random_share` keeps a plain random slice in the sheet. Without it the sheet
    only ever contains articles that already look like something we know, the
    labels drift towards confirming the retrieval, and prevalence becomes
    impossible to estimate from any later round.

    `max_similarity` stops one heavily-covered event filling a class's quota.
    Retrieval alone returned four rewrites of the same TikTok privacy settlement
    for `tech_security`; near-duplicate grouping missed them because each
    newsroom reworded the headline. Four copies of one story cost four times the
    attention and teach the model one story.

    The default is measured, not guessed: on this corpus, rewrites of one story
    score 0.25 to 0.52 against each other, while genuinely different articles on
    the same subject sit near 0.18. Anything above 0.3 is therefore far more
    likely to be the same event than a second example of the class.

    Retrieval is a *suggestion of where to look*, never a label: the returned
    articles are shuffled into one sheet and `retrieved_for` is kept out of it,
    because an annotator shown a proposed class will agree with it.
