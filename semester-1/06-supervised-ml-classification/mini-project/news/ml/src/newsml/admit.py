"""Admission filters, and a rejection log that accounts for every dropped article.

The Phase 2 acceptance criterion is strict: the rejection log must explain 100%
of the difference between input and output counts, by reason code. So admission
is written as a total function — every article returns either an acceptance or
exactly one `Rejection`, and `partition` asserts the arithmetic before returning.

The cleansing funnel with drop reasons is also one of the report figures, and it
is the figure almost nobody produces.
