"""Assemble the supervised dataset the classifier trains on.

Everything upstream of this module is unsupervised bookkeeping: cleansing,
admission, near-duplicate grouping. This is where an article becomes an
`(x, y)` pair, and where the two decisions that shape v1 are enforced:

* **Labels collapse to the top-level group.** The taxonomy is two levels deep,
  but only its groups carry enough weakly-labelled articles to learn from. A
  child label is folded into its parent here rather than in the taxonomy, so
  widening the corpus later restores the finer classes without relabelling.
* **A class below `min_per_class` is out of scope, not a class with few
  examples.** Its articles are removed from the supervised set and counted.
  `crime_justice`, `conflict_war` and `disaster_accident` receive no weak label
  at all, so a model trained here can never emit them — reporting how much of
  the corpus that silently excludes is the point of counting it.

    A gold label wins outright: that is the whole reason for collecting it, and
    it is the only way a class no RSS section names can enter the class list.

    `holdout` is the opposite arrangement, and the honest one: the same human
    labels are withheld from training entirely and returned as their own split,
    so the model is scored against people instead of against the weak teacher
    that trained it. The whole near-duplicate group of a held-out article is
    withheld too — otherwise a reworded wire copy of a scored article sits in
    train and the number flatters itself.

    Passing both is the arrangement a shipped model needs: one slice of the
    human labels teaches the rare classes, a disjoint slice scores the result.
    Only an article appearing in both is an error, because that is the one case
    where the model is tested on a label it was handed.

    `collapse_to_group` off keeps the finer child classes the taxonomy defines,
    which only became possible once enough of them had been hand-labelled. Turn
    `use_weak_labels` off alongside it: weak labels resolve to groups, so mixing
    the two makes a class list where a parent competes with its own children.
