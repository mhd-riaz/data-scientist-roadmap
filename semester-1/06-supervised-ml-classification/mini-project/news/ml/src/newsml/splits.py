"""Train/validation/test splits that are both grouped and temporal.

Two constraints, and they fight each other:

* **Grouped** — no story cluster may span two splits. A syndicated story in both
  train and test is memorisation scored as generalisation.
* **Temporal** — every test article is published after every training article.
  Anything else lets the model see the future, and news vocabulary moves fast
  enough that the difference is large.

Satisfying both exactly is impossible when a story straddles a cut point, so the
straddling articles are dropped and counted. Dropping them is honest; silently
relaxing either constraint is not. The drop count is reported and belongs in the
data card.
