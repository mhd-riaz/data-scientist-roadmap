"""Demo UI for the news topic classifier.

Two things this is trying to show, beyond "it predicts a class":

1. **The confidence number means something.** It has been corrected so that 0.80 really
   does mean right about 80% of the time -- the "is the confidence honest?" chart on the
   Validation tab is the evidence, and the confidence threshold in the sidebar is what
   that honesty buys you.
2. **The model can say "I don't know".** Below the threshold it declines rather than
   guessing, which is why accuracy on what it files (83%) is well above accuracy when it
   is forced to answer everything (78%).

This screen is shown in a live viva, so the copy stays inside the course vocabulary --
confusion matrix, precision/recall/F1, macro-averaging, decision boundary, threshold,
train/validation/test, bootstrap, bagging and boosting. Anything the module did not cover
is either glossed in one line or kept off the screen.

No logic lives here. Everything comes from `newsmlv2.serve` and the metrics written by
`newsmlv2 train`, so the demo cannot drift from the measured model.

**So is this an ensemble?** No. An ensemble means several models each answer *the same
question* and their answers are combined — bagging, boosting, voting, stacking. Here only
one stage answers the question "which topic is this?". The others turn text into numbers,
rescale a score, and compare against a cut-off. Chaining stages that each do a *different*
job is a pipeline, not an ensemble.

The one thing that genuinely is averaging is the five folds — five copies of the same model,
each trained on a different four-fifths, their probabilities averaged. Structurally that is
the bagging side of the family, but the folds are disjoint rather than drawn with
replacement, and they exist so each calibration curve has data its own model never saw. The
averaging falls out of that design; it was not chosen to improve accuracy.

Every real ensemble was tried as a *challenger* and lost: boosted trees −0.036 macro-F1,
random forest −0.041 to −0.087, majority vote +0.001. That comparison is below.

    st.markdown(
        """
**1 — Every word becomes a column.** Reading only the training set, the model lists every
distinct word and every adjacent word-pair it sees: **227,846 columns**. An article is then
one row across those columns. The number in a cell is not a plain count. It goes *up* the
more times the word appears in that article, and *down* the more articles in the whole
corpus contain it — so *the* and *said* are worth almost nothing, while *wicket* or *repo
rate* are worth a lot. Repeats are damped too: a word ten times over is informative, but
not ten times as informative as once. Columns seen fewer than twice in training, or in more
than 60% of it, are thrown out before training even starts.

**2 — Then the same text is read again as letters.** A second set of **72,422 columns**
counts every run of three to five letters inside the first 600 characters. This is the part
that lets one model treat *ISRO*, *ISRO's* and a misspelling as related, that connects
*cricket*, *cricketer* and *cricketing*, and that still has something to say about a word
the training set never saw — a brand-new name still shares letter runs with familiar ones.

**3 — The two views sit side by side.** 227,846 + 72,422 = **300,268 columns**. A single
article fills in only a small fraction of them, so the row is stored as a sparse list of
"column 41,203 has value 0.18" rather than 300,268 mostly-zero numbers.

**4 — The classifier is a weighted sum.** For each of the 13 topics there is one weight per
column — a 13 × 300,268 table of numbers, which is the entire model. To score an article
for *Sport*, take every column it filled in, multiply by that column's *Sport* weight, add
them all up, add a constant. That sum is the distance from a decision boundary: positive
means "this side of the line, Sport", negative means "the other side". Thirteen topics means
thirteen separate lines, each drawn between one topic and the other twelve together — the
one-vs-rest way of doing multi-class with a two-class model. Whichever score comes out
highest is the answer.

**5 — The weights are learnt by widening the gap.** Training nudges each set of weights
until the correct topic's score sits above the rest by as wide a margin as it can manage,
while a penalty holds the weights themselves small. That penalty is what stops 300,268
columns from simply memorising 5,487 training articles. Each topic's mistakes are also
scaled up in proportion to how rare it is, so Education and Environment are not quietly
sacrificed to get Politics and Sport right.

**6 — A score is not a probability, so it gets converted.** The raw sum can be 0.4 or 3.1
and means nothing on its own. To fix that, the training set is cut into five folds; for each
fold the model is refitted on the other four and scored on the fold it never saw, and those
held-out scores are lined up against what the answers actually turned out to be. That gives
a curve mapping "score of 1.7" to "right about 88% of the time". Five such curves are
averaged into the one the app uses. Because every score behind the curve came from data the
model had not seen, the resulting confidence is honest — and the *is the confidence honest?*
chart on the Validation tab is the check, not the claim.

**7 — Only then does the threshold apply.** The top probability is compared against the
threshold in the sidebar. Above it the article is filed; below it, held for a person.

Suppose the article is *"India beat Australia by six wickets in the final over"*.

1. It fills in a small fraction of the 300,268 columns — `india`, `beat`, `australia`,
   `wickets`, `final over`, plus letter runs like `wic`, `cket`, `kets`.
2. Each gets a value: `wickets` is rare across the corpus, so its value is high; `india`
   is everywhere in this corpus, so its value is low.
3. For *Sport*, every one of those values is multiplied by its *Sport* weight and the
   products are added up. Say that comes to **+2.9**.
4. The same values are run against the *Politics* weights: **−1.4**. And against the
   other eleven topics.
5. Highest wins — *Sport*. Its score of +2.9 goes through the conversion curve and comes
   out as, say, **0.94**.

**The uncomfortable finding is the useful one.** If something could always pick the right
model out of the ten tried, it would score 0.900 — so the models genuinely do disagree,
which is exactly the diversity an ensemble is supposed to feed on. Yet every ensemble that
can actually be built lands on 0.771. The disagreement is one-sided: the sentence-feature
model rescues 70 articles the linear model got wrong while breaking 148 it had right, and
a majority vote has no way of telling which side of that trade it is on.

So the accuracy came from **data preparation**, not from the classifier. Removing repeated
furniture lines, grouping near-identical copies of the same story, deciding which articles
were fit to train on, and splitting the data honestly did the work. The model itself is a
plain linear one, and every attempt to replace it with something heavier lost.

- **Train, validation and test share no story and no day.** No story appears in two
  splits, and every test article was collected after every training article, so the test
  set is a genuine future rather than a random slice of the same days.
- **Intervals resample whole stories, not single articles.** Sampling with replacement
  — the bootstrap idea bagging is built on — over articles would treat five papers
  running one wire story as five independent observations, and report an interval
  narrower than the truth.
- **Two publishers are held out completely** (The Hindu, The Guardian) and scored on
  every run, with the model refitted from scratch without that publisher each time. The
  Guardian is the hard one: not Indian, and a different house style.
- **The test set was opened once**, through a single function that refuses to run without
  an explicit flag, after the model was frozen. It has not been reopened — a held-out set
  stops being held out the moment it changes a decision.
- **Two models are compared only on the articles they disagree about** (McNemar's test),
  not by subtracting two accuracy numbers, so a claimed improvement has to survive the
  cases that actually differ.
- **The raw score is never shown as a confidence.** A linear model outputs an unbounded
  number, not a probability — the same reason logistic regression puts a sigmoid on top
  of its weighted sum. Here that number is converted into a probability using a
  conversion fitted on cross-validation folds *inside* the training set, which is why the
  confidence can be checked honestly against how often it is right.
