"""The shipping model: fit it once, persist it, classify one article at a time.

Everything up to Phase H answered "is this model any good?". This module answers the
only question left over, which is "how does a person use it?" -- and it is deliberately
the *same* model, not a convenient approximation of it:

* fitted on **train only**, because every number in `docs/plan.md` was produced by a
  train-only fit. Refitting on train+val would ship a model that no reported figure
  actually describes, in exchange for accuracy nobody could quote.
* calibrated by the measured recipe -- five grouped folds of train, each with its own
  base estimator and isotonic calibrator, averaged. That is what `confidence.
  cross_validated_probabilities` does at evaluation time, so persisting the five folds
  reproduces the evaluated behaviour exactly rather than approximating it with
  `CalibratedClassifierCV(ensemble=False)`.
* one global confidence cut, read from the train out-of-fold probabilities, never from
  anything the model is scored on.

A `LinearSVC` margin is a signed distance from a hyperplane, so nothing here ever
returns one. Confidence is always a calibrated probability.
